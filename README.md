# Clickbait detection

This project aims to develop a clickbait detection model using machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The dataset consists of article titles from before the COVID era, and the model utilizes both pretrained GloVe embeddings and tf-idf values to represent the titles. Multiple machine learning algorithms were used for prediction, like Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression, with the project achieving 96% accuracy with titles from the year 2017 and before. The next steps for this project would be to start scraping article titles from 2020 to the current date to properly train the models with today's language. I plan on updating the repository shortly to include comprehensive Jupyter Notebook documentation, providing insights into the code implementation and detailed graphs to explain the model's behavior and performance.
